      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>
        I started off as a teacher. Considering different learners have
        different learning abilities, I had to learn different teaching
        techniques to ensure I was helping every student. This has helped me in
        adapting the fast pace of changing technologies. I am eager to learn
        every day and improve my soft and hard skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        I got drawn into the development world when I came across "Hour of Code
        on Khan Academy," I started to teach students the basic HTML and CSS,
        and I, myself, got hooked.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the last months, I have managed to build a portfolio website,
        FakeStore and a to-do list project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and
        React. This may seem like a small feat, but I have learnt a ton of
        things like working with a diverse team to achieve results thanks to
        Microverse, where together with developers from all over the world, we
        collaborate through pair-programming sessions and build real-life
        projects together.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe my hard work, love for clean code, and accessible and
        responsive design will lead my way to a high-level role in the
        companies.
      </p>
