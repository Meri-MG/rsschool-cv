#### Summary

I started off as a teacher. Considering different learners have different learning abilities, I had to learn different teaching techniques to ensure I was helping every student. This has helped me in adapting the fast pace of changing technologies. I am eager to learn every day and improve my soft and hard skills.

I got drawn into the development world when I came across "Hour of Code on Khan Academy," I started to teach students the basic HTML and CSS, and I, myself, got hooked. 

Over the last months, I have managed to build a portfolio website, FakeStore and a to-do list project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. This may seem like a small feat, but I have learnt a ton of things like working with a diverse team to achieve results thanks to Microverse, where together with developers from all over the world, we collaborate through pair-programming sessions and build real-life projects together.

I believe my hard work, love for clean code, and accessible and responsive design will lead my way to a high-level role in the companies.
